# Tableau_Project
Here the tableau project is implemented through:
1. Creating the persona through specific questions
2. Resolving and answering the questions with visualizations in clear
This will help in improving problem-soving skills using any visualization tool easily. For more details, check the document "Data Visualization Project"
**1.2 Persona and Questions**
Video games have become a lucrative investment for banks and financial institutions. With 
the steady growth of the gaming industry, many banks have recognized the potential for 
high returns on investment in gaming industries. ABC Bank Investment manager, who checks 
the portfolio of the bank, intends to broaden its portfolio by venturing into the gaming 
industry. To execute this, the bank's research team collected data and solicited the expertise 
of its Data Analytics team to provide insights on the below two questions. 

1. What is the year-over-year (YOY) growth rate of video game sales in the three markets 
(NA, EU, JP) launched between 1996 and 2016 and how have the top five publishers 
performed during this period?
2. What is the strength of the correlation between user count and sales for video games 
launched between 1996 and 2016 and is there a variation in sales among different 
genres in the gaming industry and what is the total sales value for each genre?

**Addressing question 1** would enable the investment bank to determine which market has 
the most substantial growth rate and assess the sales value of the top five publishers during 
the period analyzed.
**Addressing question 2** would facilitate the bank in evaluating the extent to which user count 
influences game sales and in identifying whether there is variability in the impact of user 
count on sales among different gaming genres.
**1.3 Requirements:**
Q1. What is the year-over-year (YOY) growth rate of sales in the three largest markets for 
major games launched between 1996 and 2016, and how have the top five publishers 
performed during this period?
R1: To answer this question, the user needs to create a line chart with lines showing the YOY 
growth of each market (Europe, Japan, and North America).
R2: In addition to this, the user also needs to create an area chart to show the sales value of 
the top 5 publishers over the period of 30 years.
Q2. What is the strength of the correlation between user count and sales for video games 
launched between 1996 and 2016, and is there a variation in sales among different genres 
in the gaming industry and what is the total sales value for each genre?
R1: To answer this question the user must create a scatter plot with the user count on Xaxis and global sales value on the Y-axis.
R2: Additionally, the user should also create a bar graph showing sales value by genre. This 
graph needs to be interactive so that clicking a particular bar and scatter plot will reflect and
show the relationship between user count and sales for that genre.
R3: The user must create a global filter for genre and platform which will help the bank to 
see the scenario in more detail. 
R4: All views should fit in the dashboard without the need for scrolling. The dashboard should 
be viewed on a desktop, as the mobile view will change the orientation to optimize the view, 
which will require scrolling.
R5: The user should have a basic understanding to visualize bar graph, area chart, line chart,
and a scatter plot, also have a decent statistical understanding to understand correlation and 
R-squared.
R6: Should have a basic understanding of presentation mode in Tableau and Power BI
R7: The user should be aware of chart interactivity as it enables the users to select different 
filters and variables which will help to gain deeper insights into the data.
